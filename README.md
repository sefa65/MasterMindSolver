# MasterMindSolver

This is a quickly coded and poorly optimized Master Mind Solver based on the algorithm described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR_71HyBytE)

The number of character can be changed by changing `MAX_SIZE` but the available digits aren't because I'm way too lazy to do it now...
